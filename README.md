# Book Recommendation System

## 📚 Overview
The **Book Recommendation System** is a machine learning project that suggests books to users based on their preferences and past ratings.  
This system leverages collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized recommendations, helping readers discover books they are most likely to enjoy.

---

## ✨ Features
- 📖 **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggests books based on user ratings and reading history.  
- 🔍 **Top Rated Books:** Displays books with the highest average ratings.  
- 🧠 **Collaborative Filtering:** Uses machine learning algorithms to recommend books similar to ones users have liked.  
- 🗂️ **Data-Driven Insights:** Built on a dataset containing books, users, and ratings.
